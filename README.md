## Description

This is a Udacity minicourse project for JavaScript Design Patterns. It revises the online résumé project from several months earlier.

### Features

- Model with JSON objects representing bio, work, project and education info
- Octopus (controller) that gets data from the model and loads all the views
- Views for the various sections of the résumé:
    - Bio header and footer
    - Work experience
    - Recent and past projects
    - Education section
    - Embedded Google map with pins on all locations mentioned
    - Floating “back to top” button and smooth scrolling for anchor links

### Credits

Unlike most (if not all) of my Udacity projects, this one actually owes much of its success to the course videos. The course instructor gave enough practice at building an app from scratch and refactoring code, so I rarely had to consult the forum this time. Thanks also to those who posted questions and answers on Stack Overflow. Links to relevant threads are included as comments in my JS code.

I adapted code provided by [Cotswold Photo](http://cotswoldphoto.co.uk/bootstrap-float-to-top-button/) and [HTML-Tuts](http://html-tuts.com/back-to-top-button-jquery/) to implement the floating button, and by [Sycha Web Resources](http://www.sycha.com/jquery-smooth-scrolling-internal-anchor-links) for smooth scrolling.
